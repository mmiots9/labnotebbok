This project aims to help bioinformaticians in creating the so called "Laboratory notebook" in an automatic way. 

**IMPORTANT**: this tools is based on git and its application, you need to commit things and changes to be able to use this tool. 
In fact, based on git history, it will create an html notebook divided by date and commit.

<h3>Features</h3>
<li>Automatically create a laboratory notebook</li>
<li>Customizable CSS file</li>
<li>Possibility to ignore the labnotebook folder</li>
<li>Possibility to ask for analysis file</li>
<li>Export to html</li>

<h3>Installation</h3>
To install these functions, I strongly reccomend to download the entire folder and add this to your .bash_profile or .zshrc:

```
for file in ~/path-to-folder/*.sh; do source "$file"; done
```
<h3>Notebook structure</h3>
The structure of the notebook is very simple. You can see an example <a href='./example.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.

On top, you have the notebook name, the author and the date of creation. Then, for each day, you have a list of all the commits done, organized as follow:
<li>Commit message (first line)</li>
<li>Commit body</li>
<li>sha</li>
<li>Analysis file (if set)</li>
<li>List of changed files</li>

<h3>Create a notebook</h3>
To create a notebook, go to the folder in which is present the .git folder and type <code>createnotebook \<name_of_the_notebook\></code>.  
A .labnotebook folder is created, containing config file, a basic css file and three file containing head, body and footer of the html file.

**IMPORTANT**: never change the name of the created folder and its files. 

<h3>Update a notebook</h3>
When you want to update the notebook inserting the info abut the commits, go to the folder in which is present the .git folder, type <code>updatenotebook</code> and follow the instructions.

**IMPORTANT**: If you have set to NOT ignore .labnotebook folder, after each notebook update a commit is made with labnotebook as author.

<h3>Export html file</h3>
When you want to export the full html file containing the notebook, go to the folder in which is present the .git folder, type <code>exportnotebook \<file_to_create.html\></code>
